Open a ticket and change the Priority, Department, and SLA acording to needs of the Ticket.

</p>
<br />
You can also add comments/updates on the Tickets progress so that the departments can see.  Once the Ticket is resolved click on Status -> click Resolved.

Do this with every ticket accordingly until each ticket is assigned and solved.
